            <p> My rendition: 
                CKep's ramen is special. It is guaranteed to not be anything like homemade ramen that someone like <em>you</em> has ever made.
                Ckep's ramen comes packed with not only flavor, sodium, and protein, but <strong>love</strong>. That heated love warms
                the whole dish from noodle tip to sauce drop.
